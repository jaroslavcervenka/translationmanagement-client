This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) example of client for [translation management API](https://github.com/jaroslavcervenka/translationmanagement-api).

It provides implementations of useful concepts.

Patterns
- Clean architecture
- Use features as logic scaffolding
- Global application state
- Separate domain and DTO
- Response payload validation

Libraries
- Next JS
- Redux Toolkit
- React Hook Form
- Tailwind CSS
- ts-auto-guard
- Storybook
- Cypress

## TODO
There are a few things I need to improve and implement. Sorry for that.
I hope it will be ASAP.

- Architecture diagram
- Unit, integration and UI tests
- Generate type guards into 1 common file
- Use Tailwind components
- Separate form components
- Use logging library

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
